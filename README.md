## Problem Statement 1 

There are various regions whose Temperature , Rainfall and Humidity are given within a csv file. 
Go ahead and determine the yeild based on the standard average weight of the seed.

### Formula used 
Average Yeild = ( Weight1 * Temp + Weight 2 * Humidity + Weight3 * Rainfall )
We can do this by cereating various arrays , but that would  be a lot of lines , right ?
After calculating the yeild add the field to the given csv and save it as a new file.
